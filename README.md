NestedJS
========

NestedJS is a lightweight library to implement the nested set model 
in JavaScript applications. 

The (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model)[Nested Sets Model) 
is a technique used for representing hierachrial data as a tree-like data
structure.

Although very convienient and fast when implemented using a relational 
database system, it's troublesome to implement procedurally.

This library helps bridging the gap between back-end data structures
and front-end implementations. 

API
----
The library follows a DSL-like usage structure, whereby method chaining
is encouraged. Currently it provides methods to verify relationships,
retrieve relationships and to find a particular node in the tree
by matching meta data within nodes or co-ordinates.

Please see (API.md)[API.md] for more information.

Requests
----
I Highly encourage anybody using this library to suggest features
that will find useful, or features that are simply lacking.

Please either create a issue, or feel free to submit a pull request.
